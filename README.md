## ⚡️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- FFmpeg (for video processing)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YT-Video-Downloader.git
cd YT-Video-Downloader
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Groq API Configuration (required for AI summaries)
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here # Refer to .env.example
```

### Step 5: Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 6: Access the Application

The application opens automatically in a desktop window when you run the script. This happens because of the following code in the main section of `app.py`:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    def run_flask():
        app.run(debug=True, use_reloader=False)

    flask_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_flask)
    flask_thread.daemon = True 
    flask_thread.start() 
    time.sleep(1)

    # Open the desktop window
    webview.create_window(
        'YT Video Downloader & Analyzer',
        'http://127.0.0.1:5000',
        width=1200,
        height=800,
        resizable=True,
        min_size=(800, 600)
    )
    webview.start()
```

This code:
1. Starts the Flask server in a separate thread
2. Creates a desktop window using `webview` that displays the web interface
3. Automatically opens the application window

**Alternative: Web Browser Only**

If you don't want the application to open in a desktop window and prefer to use it only in your web browser, replace the main section of `app.py` with this simpler version:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Then manually open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

The web browser version will work identically to the desktop version, but you'll need to manually open the URL in your preferred browser.
